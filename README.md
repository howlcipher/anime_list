# Retro Anime Archive

A sleek, retro-minimalist web application for viewing and comparing AniList profiles. 

## Features

- **Live AniList Data:** Dynamically fetches completed and currently watching anime lists directly from the AniList GraphQL API. No backend required!
- **Dynamic Theming:** The entire UI accent color automatically adapts to match the dominant color of the cover art from your most recently completed show.
- **Compare Mode:** Enter two AniList usernames to instantly cross-reference your watch histories. 
  - View shared shows (with both of your scores side-by-side).
  - See what shows you've watched that your friend hasn't (and vice versa).
  - The UI splits to represent User 1 as the primary accent color and User 2 as the secondary accent color.
- **Retro Aesthetic:** Uses `Space Grotesk` and `IBM Plex Mono` typography with a high-contrast, chunky-border design.
- **Accessibility First:** 
  - Built-in Dark and Light modes.
  - Colorblind mode that uses high-contrast black/white and dashed borders to ensure scores are distinguishable without relying on color.
  - Fully navigable via keyboard with ARIA screen-reader labels.
- **Statistics Banner:** Quickly see total completed shows, currently watching shows, and the exact mean score across the profile.
